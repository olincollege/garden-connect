							<h1>Become the best gardener that you can be</h1>
						</header>
						<p>Whether you’re tired of running to the store for tomatoes or want to grow flowers to beautify
							your home, there are many benefits to learning how to garden. Proper tactics for nurturing
							plant life can save you time and money, and also become a highly-enjoyable hobby. If you’re
							starting with nothing, you may ask, “How can I learn gardening?” It does not require any
							special kind of person — just practice, supplies, and knowledge. </p>

							<h3>Basil</h3>
							<p>Basil is a low-maintenance, tasty herb that can flourish in even a small pot! Make sure
								to cut the flowers to give more energy to the leaves , and also make sure to not

							<h3>Cucumbers</h3>
							<p>Cucumbers are a fun crop to incorporate in your garden or simply in large pots. There are
								two main types of cucumbers, vining and bush cucumbers, both of which consistently grow
								cucumbers throughout the entire growing season. If you're growing a vining variety, make
								sure to also buy a trellis (or grow it near a slotted fence!) for it to grow on, but
								bush varieties should probably be planted in actual garden beds. Make sure to regularly
								harvest the cucumbers and water them frequently, but there are tons of different ways
								you'll be able to use them!

								maintenance plant that doesn't need much water or care, and you only need one or two
								pots to have more than enough for any meal. Keep it in a well-lit area and occasionally
								pinch off the flower buds but other than that, just plant and enjoy having a tasty herb!

								or a fence to keep out rabbits and other rodents!</p>
